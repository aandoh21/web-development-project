<div><p>Hi. My name is Aldrick Andoh. I am 21 years old and currently attend Kennesaw State University. I am currently an Information Technology Major. I used to be a Computer Science Major until I reached Calculus 2 and realized that the class would be a major hurdle for me and switched to Information Technology as I had completed the most classes for it.</p></div>
