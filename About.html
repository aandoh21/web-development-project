    <h2>Quick Facts</h2>
    <p>Hi. My name is Aldrick Andoh. I am 21 years old and currently attend Kennesaw State University. I am currently an Information Technology Major. I used to be a Computer Science Major until I reached Calculus 2 and realized that the class would be a major hurdle for me and switched to Information Technology as I had completed the most classes for it.</p></div>

    <h2>My Life</h2>
    <p>I grew up in Douglasville, Georgia for my whole life. It is a really boring city with nothing to do. The only place there is to go to is the Arbor Place Mall, but it sucks. I am the oldest of 4 kids and I am the only boy. My parents are immigrants from Ghana and Ivory Coast. I worked my first job when I was 19 at a restaurant called Shane's Rib Shack. It paid only $10 an hour and I didn't get that many hours but it was a easy job, so I did not really mind it too much. My second job was in a warehouse where I just stacked pallettes and sorted things into boxes all day. I worked at that job during the summer of 2024. I was paid 15 dollars an hour. I worked there 40 hours a week, so it was like a normal job.</p>

    <h2>Hobbies and Goals</h2>
    <p> In my free time I mostly hangout with friends and play video games. I play a lot of Overwatch 2, my main is Junkrat. I also play a lot of Guilty Gear: Strive and in that game I main I-No.  I really like Borderlands and have even started a playthrough of Cyberpunk 2077. Even though I've played a lot of games in my life,  I can't really pick a favorite.. I have been thinking about getting into drawing and origami, but I get discouraged easily when I'm not instantly good at something. I also feel like I might not find them that fun which makes it hard for me to get into new things.</p>
    <p>In terms of goals, I don't really know what I want to do. When I was a kid I really wanted to be an astronaut or an archeologist, but I quickly lost interest in that. I also wanted to be a youtuber at one point, but soon realized that is incredibly unrealistic. I know its pretty bad to not have an idea of what I want to do as I'm a junior in college, but there aren't many things that are appealing to me. I know a couple things I want in a  job in the future. I want to have a short commute. I don't really want to leave Georgia and I want to make enough money so that I don't have to worry about finances too much. I only really chose my major in college because I thought I might like it and so far I do enjoy it. I guess its working out in my favor for now at least.</p></div>
