<div><p>Hi. My name is Aldrick Andoh. I am 21 years old and currently attend Kennesaw State University. I am currently an Information Technology Major. I used to be a Computer Science Major until I reached Calculus 2 and realized that the class would be a major hurdle for me and switched to Information Technology as I had completed the most classes for it.</p></div>
<div><p>I grew up in Douglasville, Georgia for my whole life. I am the oldest of 4 kids and I am the only boy. My parents are immigrants from Ghana and Ivory Coast. I worked my first job when I was 19 at a restaurant called Shane's Rib Shack. It paid only $10 an hour and I didn't get that many hours but it was a easy job, so I did not really mind too much. My secenod job was in a warehouse where I just stacked pallettes and sorted things into boxes all day. I worked at that job during summer and was paid $15. I worked there 40 hours a week, so it was like a normal job.</p></div>
